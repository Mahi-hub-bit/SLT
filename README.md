Abstract

In today's diverse and inclusive world, effective communication is essential, and bridging the gap between different languages, including sign language, is a crucial step towards creating an inclusive environment. Our project, the Sign Language Translator, represents a pioneering effort to facilitate seamless communication between individuals proficient in sign language and those who rely on spoken language.
Introduction

Effective communication is the cornerstone of human interaction, and for individuals with hearing impairments, sign language serves as a primary medium of expression. However, the gap between sign language and spoken language often poses challenges, hindering smooth communication and creating barriers in various aspects of life. Our Sign Language Translator project aims to address this gap by developing a robust and efficient system for translating sign language gestures into spoken language or text.
Problem Statement

The lack of a reliable and efficient mechanism for translating sign language into spoken language or text has been a persistent challenge, limiting the accessibility and inclusivity of communication for individuals with hearing impairments.
Solution Overview

Our Sign Language Translator project leverages advanced machine learning algorithms and computer vision techniques to accurately interpret and translate sign language gestures into spoken language or text. The system is designed to be user-friendly and accessible, catering to the diverse communication needs of individuals with varying degrees of proficiency in sign language.
Technology Stack

    Machine Learning: [YOLP V5,Python]
    Web Technology: [Node JS,Express Js,React JS,HTML,CSS]
    

Architecture

Start
↓
User initiates the sign language translation application
↓
System initializes and displays the main interface
↓
User selects the "Capture Sign" option
↓
System activates the camera for capturing sign language gestures
↓
Camera captures the user's hand gestures
↓
Image processing algorithm processes the captured gestures
↓
System recognizes the sign language gesture
↓
Mapped gesture is converted into corresponding English text
↓
System displays the translated text on the screen
↓
User reviews the translated text
↓
If satisfied,
    ↓
    End
Else
    ↓
    User can retry capturing the sign
    ↓
    Loop back to "User selects the 'Capture Sign' option"
